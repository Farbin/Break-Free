This is our iGraphics project of undergrad level 1 term 2. It is a game of a bird who is trying to escape from an evil hunter. The player has to take the bird all the way out of the jungle, dodging the obstacles and the bullets of the hunter.

You can run the setup file to install and play the game in windows.
To run the source code, you'll need iGraphics header files and other dll files, which are not included here.
